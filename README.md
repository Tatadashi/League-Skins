//TODO (have some time constraints atm)
- UI
- better description +  mention communityDragon + skinSpotlights + Khada + Official Wiki, linkedIN links, no AI, icon
- tests
- catalog functionality first (view skins)
- filter skinlines
- save to wishlist (uses local)
- allow logins (not sure if possible yet, so can save wishlist across local wipes, should take prior over local)
- if logins work, email when sale (prob use db)
- accessbility
- cache for performance
- future plans/features (keep working on this + try get job + gamejam + Riot hackathon, maybe wiki for Bandletale) i.e. roadmap

optional
- weekly sales includes hextech rotation (maybe super limited stuff like that jax skin)
- newest skins + patch
- include pbe or have page for that
- tag system (unlikely since prob need big db which can't afford)
