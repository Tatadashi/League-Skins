//TODO (have some time constraints atm)

- UI component based
- populate DB with CDD raw json using script referencing wiki
- better description + mention communityDragon + skinSpotlights + Khada + Official Wiki, linkedIN links, no AI, icon
- tests front/back
- catalog functionality first (view skins)
- filter skinlines
- save to wishlist (uses local)
- allow logins (not sure if possible yet, so can save wishlist across local wipes, should take prior over local)
- if logins work, email (validate) when sale (prob use db)
- accessbility
- pagination?
- future plans/features (keep working on this + try get job + gamejam + Riot hackathon, maybe wiki for Bandletale) i.e. roadmap

optional

- use cloudflare r2 to host images (not sure how much, hopefully free) the cache images too (this is so not rely on CDD for images) 
- backup db with pgdump and RLS db?
- weekly sales includes hextech rotation (maybe super limited stuff like that jax skin)
- newest skins + patch
- include pbe (upcoming skins, pbe tag) or have page for that
- tag system (unlikely since prob need big db which can't afford, skinlines doable)
- some sort of import/export file (json?) system as alternative to logging in
